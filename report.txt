Synthesis reports estimate resource usage based on the logical mapping of the design, while Implementation reflects the final placed-and-routed design, which can change how resources are actually used on the FPGA.

For larger memory, instead of implementing memory using flip-flops, the design can use dedicated RAM resources on the FPGA, which are optimized for large storage and reduce FF usage. Also, a peripheral storage device could be used for very large memory requirements.
